## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Key Components

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `web_app.py` | Flask application and route handlers |
| `spotify_auth.py` | OAuth authentication and token management |
| `sort_playlist_by_release_date.py` | Playlist sorting algorithm |
| `remove_duplicates_from_playlist.py` | Duplicate detection and removal |
| `rate_limiter.py` | API rate limiting with exponential backoff |
| `redis_oauth_store.py` | OAuth state storage (Redis/in-memory) |
| `secure_token_storage.py` | Encrypted token storage |
| `error_handler.py` | User-friendly error messages |

### Security Features
